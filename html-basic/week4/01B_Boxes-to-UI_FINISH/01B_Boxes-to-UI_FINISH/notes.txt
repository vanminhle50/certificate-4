[C1] WEB COMPONENTS

1. BOXES INTO UI

Having spent much of our time exploring a range of CSS techniques, we will deal with a few other major aspects of a website build - focusing on building actual components that make up parts of a website!

------

FIRST - this folder has included the combined CSS from the prior lessons into one external stylesheet:
  -> *NEW*: 00_base.html + /images + style.css

------

SECOND - content for this portion will be SEPARATE from the build, as we will analyse the components separately as we build them!

  - 01: LINK COMPONENT: Links having visual appearance of a button

  - 02: NAVBAR COMPONENT: Inline-Float Navbar vs. Block-Float Navbar (& bonus vertical navbar)

  - 03: FORM COMPONENT: Using input-groups to help select & affect CSS with opinionated elements
